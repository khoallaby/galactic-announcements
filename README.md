# Galatic Advisors - Announcements

Hello team Galactic!

I was able to complete most of the requirements except I ran out of time implementing the pagination logic. 

I did get it working on the api side (see commented code in [routes/api.php](routes/api.php)) But not the React side.

Let me know how it looks!

## Mission Requirements

### Your Mission:

We have a need to display announcements to our users when they log into our system. We would like for you to implement a single page application that shows announcements based on the following criteria:
Frontend:
* The frontend framework should be the latest version of React or Vue.
* Over time there will be a lot of announcements so the app will need to handle paging over the data so that only a subset is retrieved and displayed at a time.
* The announcement should contain an `author`, a `date`, and the `body` defined in Markdown syntax.
* The page should render the announcement bodies in HTML with standard features such as hyperlinks working.
* You may use whatever tools and libraries you like, but make sure the result is something that we can run on our machine directly.
* Comment your code thoroughly


### Backend:

* Create a backend to feed announcements to your application
* This backend should be built with Laravel or Lumen
* Be sure to showcase your knowledge of Laravelâ€™s design patterns
* You may pull in any packages or use any tools you deem useful for the mission
* Comment your code thoroughly
When complete please also include a detailed README explaining any steps needed to install and run the application on a local environment.
